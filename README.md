# emacs-configs
emacs init file, fonts, and dashboard images

init lite: stupid simple config using built-in emacs features instead of external packages

init heavy: doom line, dashboard, themes, fonts, org stars

both init files are designed for emacs 30 or newer,
but most features (fido, eglot) should work in emcas ~29
